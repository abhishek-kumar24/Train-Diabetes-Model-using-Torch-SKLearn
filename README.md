## Using Neural Network Techniques, Build &amp; Train the Diabetes ModelðŸ’«


> Diabetes is a chronic condition in which the body develops a resistance to insulin, a hormone which converts food into glucose. Glucose is the most important factor in determining the onset of diabetes followed by BMI and Age.
Other factors such as Diabetes Pedigree Function, Pregnancies, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness and Insulin also contributes to the prediction.



## What I've learned:

âœ… Extracting insights from datasets of Thousands of Patients using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and more.

âœ… Converted the string to labels

âœ… Used Feature Normalization

âœ… Added an extra dimension to convert this array to 2D

âœ… Created the network (an object of the Net class)

âœ… Load the data to data loader for batch processing and shuffling.
